# Genetic Car Learning

Simple genetic algorithm that uses equations based on distance to wall at specific angles to tune turning and acceleration factor. Inspired by University homework of maximizing quadratic.

Larger raycast count/bits per digit/car count/mutation factor lead to faster learning but worse performance.

Plan to add:

- Sliders for car characteristics (Front/Side Aero, Accel, Top Speed, Traction, etc).
- Add acceleration, speed and rotational momentum to turning and acceleration functions to match intelligence of Machine Learning approach.
- Improve sprites and ui.
